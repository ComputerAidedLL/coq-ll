# First-Order Linear Logic in Coq

We formalize in Coq different sequent calculi for first-order linear logic (LL) and we prove them to be equivalent. We also prove some meta-theorems, including cut-elimination and the completeness of the focused system.

## Getting Started

The project was tested in Coq 8.6. No extra library is needed for compilation. 

### Building 

Typing "make" should suffice to compile the project:

```
make
```

The project documentation can be generated by

```
make html
```


## Structure of the project / proofs

We briefly describe the content (theorems and definitions) of the .v files. The documentation of the library offers more detailed explanations. 


### LL/Syntax
This file defines the syntax of linear logic and its notation.  We also define several notions needed for the focused system (e.g., negative and positive formulas, polarity of atoms, etc)

### LL/Multisets
Representation of multisets and some needed results.

### LL/SequentCalculi
We formalize different sequent calculi for Classical Linear Logic: two sided, one sided and dyadic systems. Some systems make explicit the measures (e.g., height of derivation) needed for the cut-elimination proof. 

We also specify Andreoli's triadic (focused) system. Sequents are of the shape
```
|-F- B ; M ; X
```

where

 - B is the classical context
 - M contains only positive formulas
 - X is an "arrow" that can be:
  - UP L, where L is a list of formulas (negative phase )
  - DW F, where F is a formula (positive phase)



### LL/StrongInduction
Most of the proofs require the strong induction principle. This file defines such principle. 

### LL/SequentCalculiBasicTheory
We prove that, for all systems, multiset-equivalent contexts prove the same theorems (exchange rule). We also prove that the classical context (in dyadic systems) admits the usual weakening and contraction rules (preserving the height of the derivation). 


### LL/Cut_Elim
In this file we prove the cases for the elimination of the rule CUT. Each lemma corresponds to one of the connectives (and its dual). 

### LL/CutElimination
The proof of the cut-elimination theorem and consistency of LL as a corollary. 


### LL/Soundness
Proof of soundness of the focused system


### LL/Completeness
Proof of Completeness for the focused system

### LL/Examples/LJLL
The proof of adequacy of the encoding of LJ into LL
